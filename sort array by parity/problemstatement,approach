# sort array by parity

**Platform:** leetcode
**Difficulty:**Easy
**Problem Link:**https://leetcode.com/problems/sort-array-by-parity/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=array
## Problem Statement
Given an integer array nums, move all the even integers at the beginning of the array followed by all the odd integers.

Return any array that satisfies this condition.

 
### Example

Example 1:

Input: nums = [3,1,2,4]
Output: [2,4,3,1]
Explanation: The outputs [4,2,3,1], [2,4,1,3], and [4,2,1,3] would also be accepted.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0]
Output: [0]
 

## Approach / Algorithm
1. Two Pointer

This gives **O(n)** time complexity
and **O(1)** space complexity.

## Constraints
1 <= nums.length <= 5000
0 <= nums[i] <= 5000
