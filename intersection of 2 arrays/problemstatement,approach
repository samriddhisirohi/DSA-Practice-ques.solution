# intersection of 2 arrays

**Platform:** Leetcode
**Difficulty:**Easy
**Problem Link:**https://leetcode.com/problems/intersection-of-two-arrays/description/?envType=problem-list-v2&envId=sorting
## Problem Statement
Given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, return an array of their intersection. Each element in the result must be unique and you may return the result in any order.

 

### Example

Example 1:

Input: nums1 = [1,2,2,1], nums2 = [2,2]
Output: [2]
Example 2:

Input: nums1 = [4,9,5], nums2 = [9,4,9,8,4]
Output: [9,4]
Explanation: [4,9] is also accepted.
 

## Approach / Algorithm
1. sorting + 2 pointer


This gives **O( mlogm + nlogn )** time complexity
and **O(1)** space complexity.

## Constraints
1 <= nums1.length, nums2.length <= 1000
0 <= nums1[i], nums2[i] <= 1000
