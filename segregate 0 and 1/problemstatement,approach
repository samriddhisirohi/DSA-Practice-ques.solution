# median of sorted merge array

**Platform:** gfg 
**Difficulty:**Easy
**Problem Link:**https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/problems/segregate-0s-and-1s5106/0
## Problem Statement
Given an array arr consisting of only 0's and 1's in random order. Modify the array in-place to segregate 0s onto the left side and 1s onto the right side of the array.

### Example

Input: arr[] = [0, 0, 1, 1, 0]
Output: [0, 0, 0, 1, 1]
Explanation:  After segregation, all the 0's are on the left and 1's are on the right. Modified array will be [0, 0, 0, 1, 1].
Input: arr[] = [1, 1, 1, 1]
Output: [1, 1, 1, 1]
Explanation: There are no 0s in the given array, so the modified array is [1, 1, 1, 1]

## Approach / Algorithm
1. Two Pointer

This gives **O(n)** time complexity
and **O(1)** space complexity.

## Constraints
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 106
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 1
